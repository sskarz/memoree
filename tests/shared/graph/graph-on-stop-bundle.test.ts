/**
 * Bundle-level guard for the graph-on-stop tree-sitter regression.
 *
 * The bug: graph-on-stop's build path statically imports `tree-sitter` (a
 * native optionalDependency). When esbuild bundles that chain into the entry,
 * it hoists `import ... from "tree-sitter"` to the TOP of the entry file, so
 * Node resolves it at MODULE LOAD — before main()'s try/catch runs. On an
 * install without the grammar, the Stop hook exits 1 (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND).
 *
 * The fix builds graph-on-stop as its own `splitting: true` bundle so the
 * `await import("../commands/graph.js")` stays a runtime chunk load and the
 * tree-sitter statics live only in graph-chunks/. These assertions FAIL if
 * splitting is dropped or the tree-sitter chain leaks back into the entry —
 * the exact regression the unit test (which injects runBuildCommand) can't see.
 *
 * Covers both supported harnesses that register graph-on-stop.
