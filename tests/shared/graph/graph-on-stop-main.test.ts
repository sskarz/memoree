/**
 * Tests for graph-on-stop's main() orchestration. Covers the gate→lock→
 * build→release sequence and its branches:
 *   - gate decides SKIP → no lock taken
 *   - gate decides FIRE → lock attempt; if lock held by other → log + return
 *   - gate decides FIRE + lock acquired → runBuildCommand called → lock released
 *   - runBuildCommand throws → log + still release lock
 *   - decideGate throws → log + early return
 *   - MEMOREE_GRAPH_ON_STOP=0 → envDisable propagated to ctx
 *
 * Build + lock helpers are injected via MainDeps so the test doesn't touch
 * real git state, doesn't fork the bundled build process, and never holds
 * a real cross-process lock file.
