/**
 * SINGLE-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH GUARD for per-directory workspace routing.
 *
 * `.memoree` routing broke repeatedly because it was wired writer-by-writer:
 * each new code path that built a storage backend from a raw `loadConfig()` silently
 * wrote/read the GLOBAL workspace instead of the directory's routed one (the
 * skillify/goals/rules/other-agent bugs). This test makes that class of
 * regression impossible to merge.
 *
 * The invariant: every module that constructs a storage backend MUST obtain its
 * config through a router — `loadRoutedConfig` (the single entry point) or
 * `resolveDirConfig`/`resolveCaptureConfig` (when it also needs the `collect`
 * flag) — UNLESS it is explicitly allow-listed below with a reason.
 *
 * Adding a new storage call site therefore forces a choice: route it, or
 * justify why it doesn't (account-level op, creds-based, no directory context).
 * A silent unrouted writer can no longer slip in.
