/**
 * Self-drift detection: `SKILLIFY_SPEC` (hierarchical, used by the CLI help
 * renderers) and `SKILLIFY_COMMANDS` (flat, used by SessionStart inject
 * blocks) must agree on every (subcommand + option)
 * combination.
 *
 * If a developer adds a new subcommand or flag to one view but forgets the
 * other, the per-view consumers (CLI help vs. SessionStart inject) start
 * showing different surfaces — exactly the drift problem this whole module
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * The contract:
 *   - Every flat entry in SKILLIFY_COMMANDS whose `cmd` starts with a
 *     SKILLIFY_SPEC subcommand prefix must correspond to either:
 *       (a) the subcommand's base entry (matches `sub.cmd` exactly, or
 *           `sub.cmd <args>` when `args` is set), OR
 *       (b) one of `sub.options[*].flag` appended after `sub.cmd`.
 *   - Every (sub, option) pair in SKILLIFY_SPEC must appear in SKILLIFY_COMMANDS
 *     as `${sub.cmd} ${option.flag}` with the same `desc`.
