/**
 * Map the `plugins.entries.memoree.config.tuning` object from openclaw.json
 * into the `globalThis.__memoree_tuning__` dispatch that esbuild rewrote
 * `process.env.MEMOREE_X` reads to target. Called once at plugin
 * register-time, before any shared module's lazy env read can fire.
 *
 * Why this layer exists: ClawHub's per-bundle static scanner treats any
 * `process.env` access in a file that also `fetch()`-es as critical
 * `env-harvesting`. esbuild's `define` rewrites `process.env.MEMOREE_X`
 * to `globalThis.__memoree_tuning__?.MEMOREE_X` in the bundled output,
 * so the bundle has zero `process.env.X` substrings. The values still
 * have to come from somewhere — that's what this function does, sourcing
 * them from the openclaw plugin config the user controls via
 * `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. CodeRabbit + @efenocchi on PR #170 pushed
 * back on the prior inline-to-undefined approach (which silently removed
 * every env-override surface); this restores runtime tunability without
 * tripping the scan.
 *
 * The shared modules expect STRING values (mirroring `process.env`'s
 * runtime type). Booleans become `"1"` / `""`, numbers become decimal
 * strings, and `undefined`/`null` keys are omitted (so the consumer's
 * `?? "default"` fallback applies).
