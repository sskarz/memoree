/**
 * Always-on recall telemetry sink.
 *
 * Appends one JSON line per recall-worthy invocation to
 * `~/.memoree/recall-events.jsonl` — INDEPENDENT of MEMOREE_DEBUG, so
 * "did recall fire / how often / hit-rate / score distribution" is a one-line
 * `jq` over the file rather than detective work across logs. Failure-isolated:
 * telemetry must never throw or block the hook.
 *
 * Funnel events (one per prompt that PASSED the gate):
 *   injected | below | none | timeout | no-config | unattributable
 * (Gate-rejected acks/short prompts are intentionally NOT recorded — they're
 * noise; the denominator of total prompts lives in the sessions table.)
