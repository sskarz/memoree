 * Proactive-recall gate — decides whether a user prompt is worth a memory

 * Searching on every prompt is wrong: most turns are acks/continuations with

 * and injects low-relevance noise that trains the model to ignore the block.
 * This gate keeps the expensive path (embed + vector query) rare and

 * a noisy injection every turn is actively annoying.
 *
