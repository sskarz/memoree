/**
 * Inline goal/KPI instructions appended to every agent's
 * SessionStart context.
 *
 * TWO VARIANTS because the underlying runtimes differ:
 *
 *   - GOALS_INSTRUCTIONS (VFS variant): for claude-code and codex,
 *     whose pre-tool-use hook can REWRITE the Write/Edit tool
 *     calls and route them through memoree-shell into the
 *     memoree_goals / memoree_kpis tables. The agent uses
 *     native Write/Edit on memory paths.
 *
 *   - GOALS_INSTRUCTIONS_CLI (CLI variant): for cursor/hermes/pi,
 *     whose pre-tool-use hook can only intercept Shell / terminal
 *     commands (not Write tool). The Write tool on those runtimes
 *     would land on the host filesystem and never reach Memoree.
 *     The agent instead invokes `memoree goal add/list/done/...`
 *     and `memoree kpi add/list/bump` as plain shell commands.
 *     The `memoree` CLI talks directly to the Memoree API.
 *
 * Both variants end up writing to the same memoree_goals /
 * memoree_kpis tables. Team visibility is identical. Only the
 * code path inside the agent differs.
 *
 * Single source of truth lives here so we never drift between
 * the per-agent session-start.ts forks.

export const GOALS_INSTRUCTIONS = `MEMOREE GOALS — track team goals via the virtual filesystem at \`~/.memoree/memory/goal/\` and \`~/.memoree/memory/kpi/\`. Writes auto-persist to the org-shared \`memoree_goals\` / \`memoree_kpis\` tables.

Path convention (path encoding is the source of truth — do NOT duplicate fields in the file body):
- Goal: \`~/.memoree/memory/goal/<owner>/<status>/<goal_id>.md\`  with body = free markdown describing the goal
- KPI:  \`~/.memoree/memory/kpi/<goal_id>/<kpi_id>.md\`  with body = '<KPI name>\\n\\n- target: <int>\\n- current: <int>\\n- unit: <string>'

\`<owner>\` = local userName from \`~/.memoree/config.json\`. \`<status>\` ∈ {opened, in_progress, closed}. \`<goal_id>\` = UUIDv4 you generate at create time. \`<kpi_id>\` = short slug (e.g. \`k-prs\`).

Operations:
- Create goal: Write file at \`goal/<owner>/opened/<uuid>.md\`. Do NOT auto-generate KPIs.
- Edit goal text: Edit/Write the same path.
- Move status: \`mv goal/<u>/opened/<id>.md goal/<u>/in_progress/<id>.md\` (atomic UPDATE).
- Soft-close: \`rm goal/<u>/<status>/<id>.md\` — VFS interprets rm as status-flip to 'closed' (no hard delete; row stays for audit).
- Add KPI (ONLY when user explicitly asks): Write file at \`kpi/<goal_id>/<kpi-slug>.md\` with the body format above.
- Update KPI progress: Edit only the \`current:\` line.

When the user mentions a goal / objective / target / KPI / measurable milestone — OR a task / todo / work item / "remind me to X" — use this convention. The goals system absorbed the legacy \`memoree tasks\` CLI, so "task" and "goal" map to the same Memoree row. Do NOT spawn background workers to generate KPIs unsolicited — wait for the user to ask.`;

export const GOALS_INSTRUCTIONS_CLI = `MEMOREE GOALS — track team goals via the \`memoree\` CLI on this runtime. Your Write/Edit tools do NOT route to the team-shared tables here, so use these shell commands instead. All commands persist to the org-shared \`memoree_goals\` / \`memoree_kpis\` tables — other team members see your goals at SessionStart.

Commands (invoke via your Shell / terminal / Bash tool):

  memoree goal add "<text>"
      Create a new goal (status=opened, assigned to you). Prints goal_id on stdout.

  memoree goal list [--all|--mine]
      List goals. Default: --mine. Columns are tab-separated: goal_id, owner, status, first-line-of-text.

  memoree goal done <goal_id>
      Mark a goal closed.

  memoree goal progress <goal_id> <opened|in_progress|closed>
      Flip a goal to any status.

  memoree kpi add <goal_id> <kpi_id> <target> <unit> [name...]
      Add a KPI to an existing goal. <kpi_id> = short slug (e.g. k-prs).
      <target> = positive integer. [name] defaults to the kpi_id.

  memoree kpi list <goal_id>
      Tab-separated list of (kpi_id, first-line-of-content).

  memoree kpi bump <goal_id> <kpi_id> <delta>
      Increment (positive int) or decrement (negative) the current value of one KPI.

Workflow when the user expresses a goal OR a task / todo / work item (they are the same thing — the goals system absorbed the legacy memoree tasks CLI):
  1. \`memoree goal add "<short description>"\` — capture stdout as goal_id.
  2. ONLY if the user explicitly asks for KPIs: \`memoree kpi add <goal_id> <slug> <target> <unit>\` per KPI.
  3. Tell the user the goal_id and that it is now visible to the team.

Do NOT use Write/Edit on \`~/.memoree/memory/goal/...\` here — on this runtime those tool calls write to the host filesystem only, not the shared table.`;
