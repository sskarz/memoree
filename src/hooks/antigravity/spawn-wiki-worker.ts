export const WIKI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are building a personal wiki from a coding session. Your goal is to extract every piece of knowledge — entities, decisions, relationships, and facts — into a structured, searchable wiki entry.

SESSION JSONL path: __JSONL__
SUMMARY FILE to write: __SUMMARY__
SESSION ID: __SESSION_ID__
PROJECT: __PROJECT__
PREVIOUS JSONL OFFSET (lines already processed): __PREV_OFFSET__
CURRENT JSONL LINES: __JSONL_LINES__

Steps:
1. Read the session JSONL at the path above.
   - If PREVIOUS JSONL OFFSET > 0, this is a resumed session. Read the existing summary file first,
     then focus on lines AFTER the offset for new content. Merge new facts into the existing summary.
   - If offset is 0, generate from scratch.

2. Write the summary file at the path above with this EXACT format:

# Session __SESSION_ID__
- **Source**: __JSONL_SERVER_PATH__
- **Started**: <extract from JSONL>
- **Ended**: <now>
- **Project**: __PROJECT__
- **JSONL offset**: __JSONL_LINES__

## What Happened
<2-3 dense sentences. What was the goal, what was accomplished, what's left. Preserve VERBATIM any precise, non-derivable identifier that defines the work — exact token/key/secret-name values, version numbers, error codes/sqlstates, table/branch/file names, commit SHAs, config keys and their chosen values. If the session established a specific value, write that EXACT value here, not a paraphrase of it.>

## People
<For each person mentioned: name, role, what they did/said. Format: **Name** — role — action>

## Entities
<Every named thing: repos, branches, files, APIs, tools, services, tables, features, bugs.
Format: **entity** (type) — what was done with it, its current state>

## Decisions & Reasoning
<Every decision made and WHY.>

## Key Facts
<Bullet list of atomic facts that could answer future questions. Each fact should stand alone and include the EXACT, VERBATIM value where one exists — never replace a concrete identifier/value with a vague gist.>

## Files Modified
<bullet list: path (new/modified/deleted) — what changed>

## Open Questions / TODO
<Anything unresolved, blocked, or explicitly deferred>

## Next Steps
<Decide in two steps. STEP 1 — is the work this session set out to do actually finished? If it ended mid-task — a feature only half-implemented, a build or test still failing, a fix written but not yet verified, a plan agreed but not executed, a blocker hit and unresolved, or an explicit "still need to.../next I'll..." left hanging — then it is NOT finished and you MUST write a single concrete imperative line naming the unfinished work (e.g. "Finish wiring the uint32 class_label scan binding and run its test"). The session's LAST messages are the strongest signal: if they describe or show work still in progress or something left to do, that IS the next step — never suppress a genuinely unfinished task, and do not demand "substantial consequences" for it. STEP 2 — if the core work IS finished, default to exactly: none and do not invent a follow-up to fill the section. Write none when the work reached a natural stopping point, only trivial/obvious/optional polish or cleanup remains, the "next step" would just be open-ended exploration, or the only thing left is administrative wrap-up (committing, pushing, opening/merging a PR, deploying, monitoring CI — treat ALL such wrap-up as ALREADY DONE). The sole exception that still warrants a next step on otherwise-finished work is a separate, important, non-obvious item a returning engineer would NOT realize on their own and would be materially harmed by missing.>

IMPORTANT: Be exhaustive. Extract EVERY entity, decision, and fact.
PRIVACY: Never include absolute filesystem paths in the summary.
LENGTH LIMIT: Keep the total summary under 4000 characters.`;
