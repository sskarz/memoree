/**
 * Local, remote-independent migration of legacy over-long skill installs.
 *
 * Why this exists (separate from the pull-loop migration in pull.ts):
 * PR #322 caps a skill's frontmatter `name` to the codex loader's 64-char
 * ceiling and migrates a prior un-capped install — but ONLY while processing
 * a MATCHING remote row during a pull. A legacy managed install whose
 * org/workspace isn't the currently-routed one never matches a remote row,
 * so it stays un-capped forever and every codex SessionStart logs
 * "invalid name: exceeds maximum length of 64 characters" for it.
 *
 * This pass fixes those installs WITHOUT touching the network: it scans the
 * pulled manifest (~/.memoree/state/skillify/pulled.json), and for any GLOBAL
 * managed entry whose installed frontmatter `name` exceeds the loader ceiling
 * it copies the install to the canonical capped dir, caps the name there,
 * refreshes the fan-out symlinks, records the canonical manifest entry, and
 * ONLY THEN removes the stale dir + manifest row + its symlinks.
 *
 * Copy-then-swap (not rename-then-rewrite): the destructive removal of the
 * original is the LAST step, so a failure at any earlier point leaves the
 * original entry — dir, manifest row, and symlinks — fully intact and a later
 * run retries. At worst an already-capped copy is left behind, which the
 * same-rawName reconciliation on the retry collapses.
 *
 * Scope: only `install === "global"` entries are migrated. Project-scoped
 * installs belong to a specific project cwd and must not be mutated from an
 * unrelated SessionStart.
 *
 * Ownership is taken ONLY from the manifest — never inferred from directory
 * names — so an unmanaged `<rawName>--<author>` dir the user happens to own is
 * left untouched.
