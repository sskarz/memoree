/**
 * Single source of truth for the on-disk skillify state directory.
 *
 * Extracted out of `state.ts` so siblings that also live under
 * `~/.memoree/state/skillify/` (lock state, scope config, pulled
 * manifest, legacy migration) can route through one resolver without
 * pulling in `state.ts`'s heavier dependency graph or creating an
 * ESM cycle with `legacy-migration.ts`.
 *
 * The path is computed lazily on every call so tests (and any other
 * caller that swaps `process.env.HOME` or `MEMOREE_STATE_DIR` between
 * operations) actually affect the path. A module-level `const` would
 * capture the developer's real home at import time and bypass any
 * isolation, which is exactly what accumulated 80+ orphaned
 * `<key>.lock` directories on dev machines — every
 * `skillify-state.test.ts` run that the cleanup `rmdirSync` couldn't
 * reach left one behind in the real `~/.memoree/state/skillify/`.
 *
 * `MEMOREE_STATE_DIR` is honoured first so tests can point the whole
 * subsystem at a `mkdtempSync()` directory without monkey-patching
 * `os.homedir`. Falls back to `~/.memoree/state/skillify`.
