/**
 * Manual local -> Memoree skill upload — the inverse of `pull`.
 *
 * `memoree skillify push <name>` reads an existing
 * <skillsRoot>/<name>/SKILL.md and writes it to the org `skills` table as a
 * fresh append-only version. This is the escape hatch for skills the
 * background mining worker never produced: a skill Claude wrote during a
 * context-switch-heavy session, or one authored in a casual conversation the
 * summarizer / LLM gate would never turn into a skill on its own.
 *
 * Versioning is append-only, same as the worker (skills-table.ts): read the
 * latest remote version for (name, author) and INSERT at version + 1. A skill
 * not yet in the table starts at its local frontmatter version (or 1). This
 * avoids the UPDATE-coalescing quirk documented in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * Authorship follows the same lineage model as cross-author MERGE (#118): the
 * frontmatter `author` (original creator) is preserved as the row's author so
 * version bumps key on the same identity; the pushing user is appended to
 * `contributors`. A legacy local file with no frontmatter author falls back
 * to the pusher as the author.
