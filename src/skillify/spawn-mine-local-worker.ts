/**
 * Auto-trigger `memoree skillify mine-local` from a SessionStart hook on
 * fresh installs where the user hasn't signed in yet. Detached background
 * spawn — the hook returns immediately; the next SessionStart fire sees
 * the manifest and surfaces the "N skills mined, sign in to share"
 * message produced by countLocalManifestEntries().
 *
 * Design constraints (in order of importance):
 *   1. Never block the SessionStart hook. Detached spawn, no wait.
 *   2. Never run more than once per user. Skip when manifest exists.
 *   3. Never compete with a running auto-mine. Skip when lock exists.
 *   4. Never run when there's nothing to mine. Skip when ~/.claude/projects/
 *      doesn't exist (truly-fresh Claude Code install).
 *   5. Never run when the user is already signed in. Auth users get the
 *      normal Stop-hook-driven mining flow.
 *
 * The lock is a sentinel only; it does NOT enforce a race-free
 * "exactly one worker at a time" invariant. Two SessionStart fires
 * inside a few milliseconds could both pass the check, both spawn,
 * both produce skills. mine-local's manifest sentinel makes that
 * benign (second worker exits early once the first writes the
 * manifest); the lock is cheaper than tightening fs primitives.
