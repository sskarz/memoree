/**
 * Insight advisor — runs after a mine-local pass to pick the BEST
 * insight-bearing candidate from a manifest. Calls sonnet via the
 * user's claude CLI (haiku is the executor that produces N candidates
 * in parallel; sonnet is the advisor that selects one).
 *
 * Pattern (per Anthropic's "Executor/Advisor"):
 *   - Executor (haiku, parallel × N): cheap, runs once per session,
 *     produces 0-3 skill candidates each. No quality floor — haiku
 *     sometimes emits meta-commentary ("user asked to save this rule")
 *     because the session it saw was a meta-conversation, not coding.
 *   - Advisor (sonnet, single call): reads ALL candidates, ranks by
 *     quality criteria, marks the winner with `primary: true` in the
 *     manifest. If every candidate is meta-noise / vague, returns
 *     null (no banner surfaces — falls back to the count line).
 *
 * Cost: one sonnet call per mine-local run (~$0.10-0.30 with the
 * candidate set sizes we cap at). Worth the spend at install time,
 * where surface attention is the scarce resource and we get one shot
 * at the impression.
 *
 * The advisor is intentionally separate from gate-runner so the
 * haiku-parallel path stays untouched. We invoke `claude --model sonnet`
 * directly with stdin-fed prompt + parse a deterministic single-line
 * response.
