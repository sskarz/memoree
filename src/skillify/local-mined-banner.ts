 * the user hasn't signed in but `memoree skillify mine-local` has
 * produced at least one skill.
 *
 * MODEL-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION: this output goes into the model's system
 * prompt, so it must contain only statically-authored copy. We do NOT
 * render the `insight` field here, even when a manifest entry has one:
 * `insight` originates from haiku's gate output and could be influenced
 * by adversarial session content (codex P1 prompt-injection finding).
 * The rich insight banner lives in `src/notifications/rules/local-mined.ts`
 * with `userVisibleOnly: true`, which keeps it on the user-visible
 * `systemMessage` channel only.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function (no fs reads, no env, no defaults) so unit
 * tests can drive both branches with synthetic inputs.
