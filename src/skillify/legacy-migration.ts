/**
 * One-time migration of the pre-rename state directory.
 *
 * Old: ~/.memoree/state/skilify/
 * New: ~/.memoree/state/skillify/
 *
 * If the legacy directory exists and the new one does not, rename in place
 * so installed-skill manifests, scope config, and per-project state survive
 * the rename.
 *
 * Env-awareness: the *new* directory is resolved through `getStateDir()`,
 * which honors `MEMOREE_STATE_DIR`. The legacy sibling is computed as the
 * `skilify` sibling of whatever `getStateDir()` returns. When tests point
 * `MEMOREE_STATE_DIR` at a `mkdtempSync()` dir, the `skilify` sibling
 * obviously does not exist — the migration short-circuits, which is the
 * whole point: tests must never touch the developer's real
 * `~/.memoree/state/skilify` while exercising state code paths.
 *
 * Before this routing was wired, every `readState` / `writeState` /
 * `withRmwLock` / `tryAcquireWorkerLock` call inside a test would
 * stat-and-potentially-rename the real `~/.memoree/state/skilify` despite
 * the env override on `state.ts`, because this helper hardcoded
 * `homedir()`. Test pollution leaked through that channel and is what
 * accumulated the orphan lock directories the env override is meant to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Re-entrancy: a single `attempted` boolean is enough. The `MEMOREE_STATE_DIR`
 * guard at the top of the function makes this an in-process one-shot —
 * `getStateDir()` always resolves to the same canonical path when the env is
 * unset, so there's no scenario where the same process would need to migrate
 * a *different* state dir later in its lifetime.
 *
 * Error policy: swallow the documented fallback codes — `EXDEV`
 * (cross-device link, e.g. `~/.memoree` on a different mount than `/tmp`),
 * `EPERM` (sandboxed or read-only home), and the multi-process race codes
 * `ENOENT` / `EEXIST` / `ENOTEMPTY` (another worker / hook / install
 * raced past the existsSync checks and either migrated the dir or
 * recreated the target between our stat and rename — both outcomes are
 * "migration handled" from our point of view, not a failure to surface).
 * Every other failure (`EIO`, `ENOSPC`, anything else) re-throws so the
 * caller sees the I/O error instead of silently losing user state.
