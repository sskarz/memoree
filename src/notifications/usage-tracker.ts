/**
 * Count skills authored by `userName` that are visible locally — i.e.
 * directories under `~/.claude/skills/` matching `<name>--<userName>`.
 *
 * Why this signal: memoree's skillify pipeline writes mined skills to
 * the memoree `skills` table tagged with `author`. When a user (or
 * teammate) pulls those skills, they land at
 *   ~/.claude/skills/<name>--<author>/SKILL.md
 * So counting directories whose suffix matches the current `userName`
 * gives us "skills you've generated that are installed on this machine."
 *
 * What it does NOT count:
 *   - Skills you generated but never pulled to this machine (lives only
 *     in the memoree table; counting them needs the SQL+network path)
 *   - Skills you generated and later deleted from disk
 *   - Skills generated under a slightly different author string
 *
 * Trade-off: undercounts in those edge cases, but stays zero-latency and
 * accurate for the common case (skillify auto-pulls org skills on
 * session start, so authored skills usually ARE installed).
 *
 * Purely local — no network, no SQL, no LLM. Fail-soft on every step.
 *
 * Earlier version used `~/.memoree/state/skillify/<projectKey>.json`'s
 * `skillsGenerated[]` field, but that's per-project + per-machine and
 * misses skills authored in other projects or on other machines. The
 * filesystem suffix-match is broader AND simpler.
