/**
 * Local private doc store — the on-disk home for docs generated from a branch's
 * COMMITTED-but-UNPUSHED code. Such a doc describes code teammates don't have
 * yet, so it must never reach the shared cloud table (the publish gate holds
 * it). Instead it lives here, readable only by this machine's owner, until the
 * source is pushed and the next refresh promotes it to the cloud branch overlay.
 *
 * Layout: one JSON file per (project, scope) under
 *   ~/.memoree/docs-private/<project>__<scopeSlug>.json
 * holding a map `{ [doc_id]: PrivateDoc }`. A whole-file read/write keeps it
 * trivially consistent at the per-branch scale (dozens of pages).
 *
 * Each entry carries the `source_fp` it was generated from, so the reader can
 * apply the same freshness verdict as cloud docs (stale banner) and drop an
 * entry once it no longer matches HEAD.
