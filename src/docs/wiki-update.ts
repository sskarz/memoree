/**
 * Wiki update-worker — patch a page in place instead of regenerating it.
 *
 * The refresh loop feeds each stale page the ACCUMULATED unified diff of its
 * member files (`last_refresh_sha..HEAD`). The model corrects ONLY sentences
 * the diff made false — or answers NO_CHANGE. This is the cheap steady-state
 * path: most commits invalidate a line or two of prose, not the page.
 *
 * Mechanics stay code-owned regardless of the model's answer: the `## Files`
 * index and the anchors are recomputed on EVERY update, including NO_CHANGE.
 *
 * Escalation (full page regen, decided by the CALLER) fires when patching is
 * the wrong tool:
 *   - group membership changed (files added/removed — the narrative's shape
 *     is stale, not just its sentences),
 *   - many public signatures changed at once,
 *   - the page has been patched `maxPatches` times since its last regen
 *     (drift accumulates; a periodic rewrite resets it),
 *   - the model's patch blows the bounded-edit budget (a "patch" that
 *     rewrites the page is a regen wearing a trench coat).
 *
 * Writes go through `editDoc` → one UPDATE (the Memoree coalescing rule).
