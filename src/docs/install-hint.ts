 * Docs onboarding shown once, on the FIRST `memoree install`.

 * Both directions in one block so the user is never stuck: enabling and
 * disabling are one command each, and status is discoverable.
 *
 * Shown once: a sentinel file (`~/.memoree/.docs-hint-shown`) is written the
 * first time the block prints, so re-running install stays quiet. The sentinel
 * is best-effort — if the write fails the worst case is the hint shows again,
 * never a broken install.
