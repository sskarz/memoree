/**
 * Wiki refresh orchestrator — the "cron that lives in the code".
 *
 * No CI, no crontab: every dev machine is a potential refresher. The
 * post-commit trigger (and any future session hook) spawns this cycle
 * detached; the cycle itself decides whether anything should happen:
 *
 *   1. GUARDS (cheap, read-only): HEAD == last_refresh_sha → up-to-date;
 *      meta row touched less than `minPeriodMs` ago → too-soon.
 *   2. LEASE: `tryClaimTurn` (TTL 30 min, read-back verified). Losing the
 *      claim is normal — someone else is refreshing; just leave.
 *   3. WORK, O(diff): `git diff last_refresh_sha..HEAD --name-only` picks the
 *      candidate pages; each is patched in place (`updateWikiPage`), escalated
 *      to a full regen when patching is the wrong tool, or generated fresh
 *      when the subsystem is new.
 *   4. COMMIT POINT: `commitRefresh(HEAD)` — the ONLY place the sha advances,
 *      and only when every candidate succeeded. A crashed or partially failed
 *      cycle leaves the sha untouched; the next turn redoes the same window
 *      (every step is idempotent, so redoing converges). A worker that lost
 *      its lease mid-cycle is refused at the commit point.
 *
 * Everything effectful is injected (query, git, LLM run, regenerate), so the
 * whole protocol is unit-testable without a repo or a backend.
