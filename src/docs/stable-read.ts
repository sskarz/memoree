/**
 * Read-stability gate for the Memoree SQL backend.
 *
 * The backend exhibits read-after-write inconsistency: for a window after a
 * burst of INSERTs, the SAME `SELECT` returns a NON-DETERMINISTIC PARTIAL
 * subset of the rows (the backend itself reports the partial count). It
 * eventually converges, but any read in that window can silently miss rows —
 * which for the doc system means `refresh` skips stale docs, and a latest-row
 * read can resolve to an OLD version. (Repro: memoree-readafterwrite-repro.mjs.)
 *
 * Key property we exploit: every partial read is a SUBSET of the true row set
 * (counts observed range from partial up to the true count, never above). So
 * the UNION of rows across repeated reads monotonically approaches the
 * complete set. We re-read until the union stops growing for `stableReads`
 * consecutive reads (converged), or `maxReads` is hit, and return the union.
 *
 * "Two consecutive reads agree" is NOT used — two consecutive identical
 * partial reads happen often (e.g. 4,4) and would lock onto a partial set.
 * Union-until-stable cannot under-return for rows that appeared in any read.

   * fuller read arrives. The union only grows, so a few confirmations suffice.
