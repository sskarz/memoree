/**
 * Docs auto-sync trigger — spawn a detached refresh when the user opted in.
 *
 * Two call sites feed it:
 *  - `memoree graph build` (post-commit hook): the instant the build
 *    finishes, the snapshot on disk is fresh, so this is the race-free place
 *    to detect drift and regenerate docs. We do NOT touch the hook body
 *    itself (shipped + tested) — we hang the trigger off the end of the
 *    build command.
 *  - the SessionStart hook (`full: true`): the catch-up tick for pulled
 *    commits and long-idle repos that post-commit alone misses.
 *
 * The ONLY gate is the per-(org, project) consent registry the user wrote
 * via `graph init` / `memoree docs auto on` — no env var, OFF by default:
 * auto-refresh shells out to the host LLM, which costs tokens and time, so
 * consent is explicit per repo AND per org. The refresh runs in a detached
 * child so the caller never blocks on it.

 * (hash-scan of ALL docs instead of the HEAD~1..HEAD git window) — the
 * SessionStart catch-up needs it because pulled or long-idle multi-commit
 * gaps are invisible to the one-commit window; wiki-refresh needs no flag,
 * its own `last_refresh_sha..HEAD` window already spans the gap. The wiki cycle carries its own cheap guards
 * (sha-unchanged, 6h quiet period, lease claim), so firing it on every
 * commit is safe — most spawns exit in one read. Returns true if refreshes
 * were spawned, false if it was a no-op (flag off, or no CLI entry to
 * re-invoke). Best-effort and non-throwing.
