/**
 * Refresh bookkeeping for the wiki freshness loop — one reserved `_meta` row
 * per (project, scope) in the docs table.
 *
 * The row's `content` is a small JSON blob:
 *   { last_refresh_sha, claimed_by, claimed_at, patch_counts }
 *
 * Concurrency model (fault-resistant by construction):
 *   - The refresh "turn" is a LEASE, not a lock: `tryClaimTurn` stamps
 *     claimed_by/claimed_at; a claim older than the TTL is dead and can be
 *     taken over by anyone. A crashed worker leaves nothing to clean up.
 *   - Claims are verified by READ-BACK, not by UPDATE row counts: the Memoree
 *     backend can silently drop one of two rapid UPDATEs on the same row, so
 *     the only trustworthy signal is re-reading the row and seeing our own
 *     stamp survive.
 *   - `last_refresh_sha` advances ONLY via `commitRefresh` at the end of a
 *     successful cycle (the commit point). A half-done cycle leaves the sha
 *     untouched, so the next turn simply redoes the whole window — every step
 *     of the refresh is idempotent, so redoing converges.
