/**
 * Branch identity for doc rows — the value of the `scope` column.
 *
 * A doc row's `scope` encodes WHICH branch's view it belongs to:
 *   - `main`        — the canonical, public corpus (everyone sees it).
 *   - `b:<branch>`  — a shared overlay for a pushed feature branch (everyone
 *                     who is on that branch sees it; others fall back to main).
 *
 * There is deliberately NO per-user dimension in the cloud scope. Private docs
 * (generated from code that is only in a local, unpushed commit) never enter
 * the shared table at all — they live in a local store. So the only scopes that
 * reach Memoree are `main` and `b:<branch>`, and a pushed branch doc is shared
 * by the branch, not owned by a user (two teammates on the same branch push to
 * the same origin/<branch>, so the doc converges — last write wins).
 *
 * NB: this `scope` (a branch view) is unrelated to the generation `--scope`
 * (`file` | `symbol`), which is a granularity, not an identity.
 *
 * All git access goes through an injected runner so the logic is pure and unit
 * testable — same seam as wiki-refresh (`args.git([...]) => string | null`).
